Results of 50x50 matrix from my work:
matlib mult 0.002772
matlib add 9.2e-05

Results of 50x50 matrix from the library:
eigen mult 0.001312
eigen add 4e-05

Results of 500x500 matrix from my work:
matlib mult 2.62487
matlib add 0.008027

Results of 500x500 matrix from the library:
eigen mult 0.953508
eigen add 0.006539

Which program runs faster:

add - 50x50 : The eigen is faster.
add - 500x500 : The eigen is faster.

mult - 50x50 : The eigen is faster.
mult - 500x500 : The eigen is faster.

There is a difference between the adding and mult methods.
The difference is because when we add we go through one loop
while in the mult we go through 3 loops which run over each value.

The difference between 50x50 to 500x500 is that our methods need to go over
more values, and so takes longer to compute.

Eigen library is faster because it is optimized and uses the fastest
algorithms.
